clang
nano vim, neo vim, nvim

analytics 
title huge take away
things that we came up with
number that we present - numbers+facts
how that data is structured 
how you would reduce to what is important 
statements
driving things that you did 
drive home a singular fact
don't do lot of information 
no colours, readable 
don't show code
readability
how it translates visually
pictures are very powerful
lot of data but one thing that you want to talk about
just graph - no
tuning text space
tabular or graph presentation - choose wisely


final project
hardware is important 
pure performance + research in minis + application space + multi process services based system

dont make a stock trading application
minis - beyond coding
