# MiniProject1 Achievements

### Overview
This project focused on optimizing threading and memory utilization in C++ through structured phases. It aimed to enhance skills in performance-based multi-process computing.

### Key Achievements
- **Designed and implemented** a C++ process to efficiently handle a large dataset (2.15M rows) using Object-Oriented Design principles.
- **Benchmarked** the initial code to establish a performance baseline.
- **Applied parallelization techniques** (OpenMP, threading) to improve performance, achieving significant speedups.
- **Optimized data structures** and code organization to further enhance performance, demonstrating the impact of efficient memory utilization and threading on large-scale data processing.

### Technologies Used
- **Languages**: C++, CMake, Python (for graph generation)
- **Tools**: GCC/G++, Clang, CMake

### Outcome
The project successfully demonstrated the importance of threading and memory optimization in high-performance computing, providing a robust foundation for future research and development in multi-process computing.
